'''
The file SDSS contains 17 observational features and one class feature for 10000 deep sky objects observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Use sklearn's GaussianNB() function to perform Gaussian naive Bayes classification to classify each object by the object's redshift and u-g color.

Import the necessary modules for Gaussian naive Bayes classification
Create dataframe X with features redshift and u_g
Create dataframe y with feature class
Initialize a Gaussian naive Bayes model with the default parameters
Fit the model
Calculate the accuracy score
Note: Use ravel() from numpy to flatten the second argument of GaussianNB.fit() into a 1-D array.

Ex: If the feature u is used rather than u_g, the output is:
Accuracy score is 0.987
