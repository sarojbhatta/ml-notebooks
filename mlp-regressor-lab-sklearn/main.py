'''
The diamonds.csv dataset contains the price, cut, color, and other characteristics of a sample of diamonds.

Create a dataframe X containing all the features except cut, color, clarity, and price.
Create a dataframe y containing the feature price.
Initialize and fit a multilayer perceptron regressor with two hidden layers with 50 nodes each, the 'identity' activation function, max_iter=500, and random_state=123.
Print the price predictions for the first five rows of the training data.
Print the R-squared scores for the training data and the testing data, rounded to the fourth decimal place.
Ex: If random_state=12 is used instead of random_state=123, the output is:

Price predictions: [-1358.27730125  1201.00841019  4221.32812498  -446.71476115
  3499.11770257]
Actual prices:

8711     586
38897   1052
792     2862
31730    772
51461   2376
Score for the training data:  0.7985
Score for the testing data:  0.8029
